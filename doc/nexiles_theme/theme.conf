[options]
html_theme = nexiles_theme
# The “theme” that the HTML output should use. See the section about theming. The default is 'default'.

# html_theme_options
# A dictionary of options that influence the look and feel of the selected theme. These are theme-specific. For the options understood by the builtin themes, see this section.

# html_theme_path
# A list of paths that contain custom themes, either as subdirectories or as zip files. Relative paths are taken as relative to the configuration directory.

# html_style
# The style sheet to use for HTML pages. A file of that name must exist either in Sphinx’ static/ path, or in one of the custom paths given in html_static_path. Default is the stylesheet given by the selected theme. If you only want to add or override a few things compared to the theme’s stylesheet, use CSS @import to import the theme’s stylesheet.

# html_title
# The “title” for HTML documentation generated with Sphinx’ own templates. This is appended to the <title> tag of individual pages, and used in the navigation bar as the “topmost” element. It defaults to '<project> v<revision> documentation', where the placeholders are replaced by the config values of the same name.

# html_short_title
# A shorter “title” for the HTML docs. This is used in for links in the header and in the HTML Help docs. If not given, it defaults to the value of html_title.

# html_context
# A dictionary of values to pass into the template engine’s context for all pages. Single values can also be put in this dictionary using the -A command-line option of sphinx-build.

# html_logo
# If given, this must be the name of an image file that is the logo of the docs. It is placed at the top of the sidebar; its width should therefore not exceed 200 pixels. Default: None.

# html_favicon
# If given, this must be the name of an image file (within the static path, see below) that is the favicon of the docs. Modern browsers use this as icon for tabs, windows and bookmarks. It should be a Windows-style icon file (.ico), which is 16x16 or 32x32 pixels large. Default: None.

# html_static_path
# A list of paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets or script files). Relative paths are taken as relative to the configuration directory. They are copied to the output directory after the theme’s static files, so a file named default.css will overwrite the theme’s default.css.

# html_last_updated_fmt
# If this is not the empty string, a ‘Last updated on:’ timestamp is inserted at every page bottom, using the given strftime() format. Default is '%b %d, %Y' (or a locale-dependent equivalent).

# html_use_smartypants
# If true, SmartyPants will be used to convert quotes and dashes to typographically correct entities. Default: True.

# html_add_permalinks
# If true, Sphinx will add “permalinks” for each heading and description environment as paragraph signs that become visible when the mouse hovers over them. Default: True.

# html_sidebars
# Custom sidebar templates, must be a dictionary that maps document names to template names.

# html_additional_pages
# Additional templates that should be rendered to HTML pages, must be a dictionary that maps document names to template names.

# html_domain_indices
# If true, generate domain-specific indices in addition to the general index. For e.g. the Python domain, this is the global module index. Default is True.

# html_use_modindex
# If true, add a module index to the HTML documents. Default is True.

# html_use_index
# If true, add an index to the HTML documents. Default is True.

# html_split_index
# If true, the index is generated twice: once as a single page with all the entries, and once as one page per starting letter. Default is False.

# html_copy_source
# If true, the reST sources are included in the HTML build as _sources/name. The default is True.

# html_show_sourcelink
# If true (and html_copy_source is true as well), links to the reST sources will be added to the sidebar. The default is True.

# html_use_opensearch
# If nonempty, an OpenSearch <http://opensearch.org> description file will be output, and all pages will contain a <link> tag referring to it. Since OpenSearch doesn’t support relative URLs for its search page location, the value of this option must be the base URL from which these documents are served (without trailing slash), e.g. "http://docs.python.org". The default is ''.

# html_file_suffix
# This is the file name suffix for generated HTML files. The default is ".html".

# html_link_suffix
# Suffix for generated links to HTML files. The default is whatever html_file_suffix is set to; it can be set differently (e.g. to support different web server setups).

# html_translator_class
# A string with the fully-qualified name of a HTML Translator class, that is, a subclass of Sphinx’ HTMLTranslator, that is used to translate document trees to HTML. Default is None (use the builtin translator).

# html_show_copyright
# If true, “(C) Copyright ...” is shown in the HTML footer. Default is True.

# html_show_sphinx
# If true, “Created using Sphinx” is shown in the HTML footer. Default is True.

# html_output_encoding
# Encoding of HTML output files. Default is 'utf-8'. Note that this encoding name must both be a valid Python encoding name and a valid HTML charset value.

# html_compact_lists
# If true, list items containing only a single paragraph will not be rendered with a <p> element. This is standard docutils behavior. Default: True.

# html_secnumber_suffix
# Suffix for section numbers. Default: ". ". Set to " " to suppress the final dot on section numbers.

# htmlhelp_basename
# Output file base name for HTML help builder. Default is 'pydoc'.
